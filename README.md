# FED-Assignment-1

Project Overview
suzannecollinsbooks.com is used to promote and introduce her works to both her fans and book readers new to her work, thus inducing greater
book sales from people interested in her books.

This project is meant to make the suzannecollinsbooks website more accessible and user friendly to both mobile and pc users, but especially aimed towards mobile usage as the current mobile experience is quite lackluster.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is focussed on making sure that book readers, and movie viewers are able to get accurate information about Suzanne Collins' books from her website.

Decluttering. Currently, the website is quite cluttered and lacks proper hierachy, making it daunting for anyone who would like to utilise this website to find out information about her books.

Make the website responsive for mobile viewing so that information can be read easily from any device.

Add purchase options as links so that the web page viewers are able to purchase the books when they wish to.

All in all, this would help increase viewer engagement on the website, perhaps driving some books sales as well.


User Stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a new viewer, I want to easily be able to navigate the Suzanne Collins books website to discover information about her literary works, including the "Hunger Games" series, so that I can learn more about the author and her contributions to literature.

As a prospective buyer, I want direct links to reputable online bookstores so that I can easily purchase Suzanne Collins' books directly from the website without chance of getting scammed.

As a user that is interested in the latest happenings and events, I would like to have a news section on the website to be able to easily learn about any news regarding Suzanne Collins.

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
